                By availing services from TripXplo, Users are deemed to have
                read, understood, and expressly accepted the terms and
                conditions of this agreement. This agreement governs the
                transactions or provision of services by TripXplo for all
                purposes and is binding on the User. All rights and liabilities
                of the User and/or TripXplo regarding any services provided by
                TripXplo are limited to the scope of this agreement. TripXplo
                reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate access
                to any or all TripXplo websites or other sales channels and
                related services or any portion thereof at any time without
                notice, for general maintenance or any other reason. In addition
                to this Agreement, there are specific terms of service (TOS) for
                the various services or products provided by TripXplo, such as
                air tickets and holiday packages. These TOS, as provided or
                updated by TripXplo, are considered part of this Agreement. In
                the event of a conflict between such TOS and this Agreement, the
                terms of this Agreement shall prevail. Users must read and
                accept the relevant TOS for the service or product they avail.
                Additionally, service providers may provide terms and guidelines
                that govern particular features, offers, or the operating rules
                and policies applicable to each service (e.g., flights, hotel
                reservations, packages). Users are responsible for ensuring
                compliance with the terms, guidelines, or operating rules and
                policies of the service providers with whom they choose to deal.
                TripXplo&apos;s services are offered to the User conditioned on
                acceptance without modification of all terms, conditions, and
                notices contained in this Agreement and the TOS, as applicable
                from time to time. By availing of the services, the User
                acknowledges and accepts this Agreement and the TOS. If the User
                does not agree with any part of these terms, conditions, and
                notices, they must not avail of TripXplo&apos;s services. In the
                event of any conflict between the terms, conditions, and notices
                herein and the additional terms or other terms and guidelines
                contained within any other TripXplo document, these terms shall
                control.
